Build new model, and perform the following tasks
1. Complete the model so that it operates as follows	① Source_Body creates 10 materials for body (Box shaped) at time t = 0. These materials should be put in Queue_Body after creation	② Source_Part creates 1 material for part (Circle shaped) every 10 seconds. These materials should be put in Queue_Part1 after creation	③ Box shaped flowitems in Queue_Body are transported to Processor_Body by Operator1	④ Circle shaped flowitems in Queue_Part1 are transported to Processor_Part by Operator1	⑤ Process time of Processor_Body is 30 seconds (Setup time = 0)	⑥ Process time of Processor_Part is 5 seconds (Setup time = 0)	⑦ Box shaped flowitems are transferred to Combiner1 by straight conveyor	⑧ Circle shaped flowitems are transferred to Queue_Part2 by curved conveyor	⑨ Circle shaped flowitems in Queue_Part2 are transported to Combiner1 by Operator2	⑩ Process time of Combiner1 is 10 seconds. Moreover, operator2 has to handle this machine during the process time	⑪ After Combiner1, the finished products are stored in Queue_Final
